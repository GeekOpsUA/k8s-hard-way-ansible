# Security Release Process

The k8s-hard-way-ansible project has adopted a security disclosure and
response policy to ensure responsible handling of critical issues.

## Maintainers Team

Security vulnerabilities should be handled quickly and sometimes privately.
The primary goal of this process is to reduce the total time users are vulnerable to publicly known exploits.

## Disclosures

### Private Disclosure Processes

If you discover a security vulnerability or any security-related issues, please do not create a public issue.
Instead, send your report to [@GeekOpsUA](https://t.me/GeekOpsUA).
Please provide as much information as possible so that we can respond quickly.

### Public Disclosure Processes

If you are aware of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability,
please contact the admins of [@GeekOpsUA](https://t.me/GeekOpsUA) immediately so
that we can begin the patch and release process. Please provide as much information as possible.
This will help us to react quickly.

## Patch and Release Team

The Patch and Release Team will assemble to patch the vulnerability, release an update,
and publish the vulnerability disclosure when a vulnerability is acknowledged.
